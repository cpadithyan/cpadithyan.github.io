Im Adithyan Cp, a 3rd Year Integrated Mtech Student at [Bharathidasan University](https://www.bdu.ac.in/), Trichy, India. Interested in The field of Android and developing android Apps for the past 5+ Years.

I am deeply enthusiastic about computer science, software engineering, and the fascinating realms of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Throughout my academic journey, I have gained skills in developing Android applications and gained proficiency in machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and YOLO.

I did my research internship at IIIT Hyderabad, where I worked on a self-adaptive ML object detection app. This experience not only sharpened my technical skills but also instilled in me a deep passion for research and innovation in the fields of computer science and software engineering.
