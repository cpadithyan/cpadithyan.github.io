I'm Adithyan Cp, a 4th Year Integrated M.Tech (4+2) Computer Science Engineering student at [Bharathidasan University](https://www.bdu.ac.in/), Trichy, India. I am currently working with [Prof. Mahesh Mohan](https://maheshmohanmr.github.io/) at the [SpAi](https://maheshmohanmr.github.io/publications/) (Signal Processing and Artificial Intelligence) Lab at [IIT Kharagpur](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/), focusing on research at the intersection of Signal Processing, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision with an emphasis on agricultural applications.

I am deeply enthusiastic about computer science, software engineering, and the realms of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Throughout my academic journey, **I have developed Android applications for over five years** and gained proficiency in machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and YOLO.

During a research internship at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/) under [Prof. Karthik Vaidhyanathan](https://karthikvaidhyanathan.com/), I worked on a self-adaptive ML object detection app, which was presented at the [Qualcomm University Symposium 2024](https://www.qualcomm.com/content/dam/qcomm-martech/dm-assets/documents/University-Platform-Symposium-May-1-2-Agenda.pdf). This experience honed my technical skills and instilled a deep passion for research and innovation in computer science and software engineering.
