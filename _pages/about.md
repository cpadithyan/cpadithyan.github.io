My name is Adithyan Cp, and I am a 4th Year Integrated M.Tech (4+2) Computer Science Engineering student at Bharathidasan University, Trichy, India. I am currently working with Prof. Mahesh Mohan at the SpAi (Signal Processing and Artificial Intelligence) Lab at IIT Kharagpur, focusing on research at the intersection of Signal Processing, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision with an emphasis on agricultural applications.

I am deeply enthusiastic about computer science, software engineering, and the realms of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Throughout my academic journey, I have developed Android applications for over five years and gained proficiency in machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and YOLO.

During a research internship at IIIT Hyderabad under Prof. Karthik Vaidhyanathan, I worked on a self-adaptive ML object detection app, which was presented at the Qualcomm University Symposium 2024. This experience honed my technical skills and instilled a deep passion for research and innovation in computer science and software engineering.
